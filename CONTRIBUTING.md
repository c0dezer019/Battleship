# Contributing

Thank you for your contribution! If you'd like to help refine this project, then perform the following steps:

1. Clone this repo:

    `git clone https://github.com/c0dezer019/Battleship.git`

2. Self-assign an [issue](https://github.com/c0dezer019/Battleship/issues) you're interested in working on.

3. Create a branch with the following format: `name_task`

    `git branch -b name_task`

## **Pull Requests**

When you're ready to merge, create a PR (pull request) and describe in detail what you did. Do not worry about conflicts, that will be bound to happen with multiple people working on a project.

## **Collaboration**

I use Codestream. If you'd like to collaborate more fully with me and other collaborators then download the Codestream extension for your IDE/Editor (if there is one) and then send me your email (the one you use for GitHub) and I'll invite you to the team.

You can use Codestream to track project progress right from your IDE in a side panel:

- Submit code segments for code review.
- Create Codemarks, which is basically a comment. (You can see an example if you join the team).
- Manage PRs
  - See PRs for you to review.
  - See PRs that are assigned to you.
  - See PRs that are created by you.
- See what is actively being worked on.
- Track and create issues.
- Create blame maps.
- Create links to help others navigate to a particular line of code.

### **Roles**

#### ***Maintainer***

If you'd like to help manage pull requests and enforce project quality, let me know and we can work something out.

Maintainer responsibilities:

- Manage Pull Requests
- Resolve conflicts
- Fix bug issues.

#### ***Collaborator***

If you just want to contribute code or resolve issues.

Collaborator responsibilities:

- Resolve issues
- Contribute code
- Create issues based on project needs.

### **Collaborators**

- DO NOT PUSH IDE-SPECIFIC CONFIG OR WORKSPACE FOLDERS/FILES.
  - Most IDE/Editors like VS Code or IntelliJ create folders for IDE/Editor configuration. Pushing these will cause conflicts on both GitHub and with the workflows of other contributors.
  - If you'd like to share these files with someone, use some other method of file sharing.
- Please do not start a new branch or feature without first creating or assigning a corresponding issue.
- Do your best to maintain style. Code should be clean and readable.
- I prefer to use the Airbnb style guide.
- If you are unsure how to proceed, ask.
- If you do not understand something, ask the codeowner.
- Update the CODEOWNERS file if you want to actively help maintain it.
  - If you don't know how CODEOWNERS file works, here's the [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/about-code-owners).
  - If you created the directory, you own it.
  - If you created the file, you own it.
  - If you create a file within a directory you don't own, you own the file but not the directory.
  - If you contributed to an existing file, add your @ next to the existing user for an  existing file entry.
    - If you notice someone forgot to include themselves in the CODEOWNER file, ask them if they want to be included.
  - If you do not want to be a CODEOWNER, then please add the file/folder without your name and add a comment explaining as such.

### **First-timers**

If you are new to collaboration, try collaborating first before asking to be a maintainer so you understand how it all works.
