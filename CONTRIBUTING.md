## **Pull Requests**

When you're ready to merge, create a PR (pull request) and describe in detail what you did. Do not worry about conflicts, that will be bound to happen with multiple people working on a project.

## **Collaboration**

I use Codestream. If you'd like to collaborate more fully with me and other collaborators then download the Codestream extension for your IDE/Editor (if there is one) and then send me your email (the one you use for GitHub) and I'll invite you to the team.

You can use Codestream to track project progress right from your IDE in a side panel:

- Submit code segments for code review.
- Create Codemarks, which is basically a comment. (You can see an example if you join the team).
- Manage PRs
  - See PRs for you to review.
  - See PRs that are assigned to you.
  - See PRs that are created by you.
- See what is actively being worked on.
- Track and create issues.
- Create blame maps.
